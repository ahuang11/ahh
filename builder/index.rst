Introduction:
    - Type "git clone https://github.com/ahuang11/ahh.git"
    - Go into ahh folder (where setup.py is)
    - Type "pip install -e ." (may need to be in bash first!)
    - In a Python script, type "from ahh import pre, era, vis, sci, ext"
    - New releases weekly (most of the time) so use "git pull origin master" to update!
